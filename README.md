# ternary_surf
Python tool to create ternary diagrams. Main advantage from other ternary plot libraries is the possibility to plot a 4D surface on the ternary plot.

I created this tool when I needed such a feature and couldn't find it in other available plotting libraries online. Feel free to use! Any comments/ideas/suggestions are welcome.

An example is located inside trisurf.py
